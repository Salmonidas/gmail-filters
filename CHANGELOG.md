## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Share Link**: Serialises the visual builder state (conditions, logic, values) to a compact Base64 fragment in the URL hash. Any shared URL automatically reconstructs the full filter on load.
- **My Filters** (Saved Local Library): A "Save filter" button stores the current filter name, query, and conditions in `localStorage`. Saved filters appear as cards above the factory examples and can be loaded or deleted independently.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Added `manifest.json` and a cache-first Service Worker (`sw.js`). The app is now fully installable on Android, iOS, and macOS (Chrome/Safari via manual hint).
- **Modernized Library (Biblioteca)**: Renamed "Examples" to "Library" and added user-saved filters.
- **Micro-animations**: Added smooth transitions for modals (fade+scale), snackbars (slide-up), and new library rows for a premium feel.
- **UX Refinements**: Implemented a "Delete Confirmation" modal to prevent accidental data loss and a "Premium Empty State" for the Library.
- Strict **Content Security Policy** (`Content-Security-Policy` meta tag) to block XSS payloads.
- `apple-touch-icon` and iOS-specific PWA meta tags for a native-like experience.

### Fixed
- Implemented comprehensive CSS Media Queries for 100% mobile responsiveness (swipeable nav tabs, fluid tables, overflow-x protection).

- Four-color Google gradient on the brand icon (Red → Yellow → Green → Blue).

- Specialized "Guide" (Guía) tab with a 7-step illustrated tutorial for successfully creating filters in Gmail, targeting all user profiles.
- Added a direct "How to apply" (¿Cómo aplicarlo?) button in the Builder preview card that links straight to the Guide tab.
- Added a direct "How to apply" (¿Cómo aplicarlo?) button in the Builder preview card that links straight to the Guide tab.
- Highlighted the critical "Search options" (sliders) icon in the Gmail search bar within the guide to address common user friction (corrected from ▼ arrow based on latest Gmail UI).

### Changed
